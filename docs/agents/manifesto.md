## Manifesto of VRSEN AI

### ðŸ§­ Our Mission

To build the best systems for our users.  We know just like hunans agents/assistants are imperfect but if we:
* Document and maintain our designs and user documentation
* Track our work using GitHub issues
* Create unit test and integration tests against our code to meet the requirements
* Objectively review the output again the issue
* Split difficult tasks into small manageable tasks

By following ths process we can overcome our imperfections.
